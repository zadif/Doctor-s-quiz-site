      "D. The urea cycle.",
      "E. Folic acid metabolism."
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This clinical presentation is classic for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, an X-linked recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT). HGPRT is a key enzyme in the purine salvage pathway. The deficiency leads to an inability to salvage hypoxanthine and guanine, causing their degradation to uric acid and a compensatory increase in de novo purine synthesis."

      "D. Low glucose and high lactose.",
      "E. The absence of both glucose and lactose."
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The text explains that strong expression of the lac operon requires two conditions: 1) Low glucose, which leads to high cAMP, activation of CAP, and binding to the CAP site to promote transcription. 2) High lactose, which is converted to allolactose, which then binds to and inactivates the repressor protein, preventing it from blocking transcription. The combination of low glucose and high lactose results in the strongest expression."

      "D. Galactocerebrosidase.",
      "E. α-L-iduronidase."
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This clinical presentation is characteristic of I-cell disease (mucolipidosis type II). The text explains that this disorder is caused by a defect in N-acetylglucosaminyl-1-phosphotransferase, which leads to a 'failure of the Golgi to phosphorylate mannose residues (↓ mannose-6-phosphate) on glycoproteins.' As a result, lysosomal enzymes are secreted extracellularly instead of being delivered to lysosomes."

    "options": [
      "A. The actin and myosin filaments within microvilli.",
      "B. The dynein arms in the 9+2 microtubule arrangement of cilia.",
      "C. The keratin-containing intermediate filaments in epithelial cells.",
      "D. The assembly of the 9 microtubule triplets in the basal body.",
      "E. The clathrin proteins involved in vesicular transport."
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), of which Kartagener syndrome is a subtype, is caused by a defect in the dynein arms. The text states that 'Dynein arm defect → immotile cilia.' Axonemal dynein is the ATPase that links the peripheral 9 doublets and causes the bending of the cilium."

      "B. Type II collagen.",
      "C. Type III collagen.",
      "D. Type IV collagen.",
      "E. Type V collagen."
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This is a classic presentation of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). The text states that OI is a genetic bone disorder most commonly caused by defects in COL1A1 and COL1A2, leading to decreased production of type I collagen. Type I collagen is the most abundant type in the body and is a primary component of bone, skin, tendon, and dentin, which explains the patient's symptoms (brittle bones, blue sclerae, and dentinogenesis imperfecta)."

    "question": "A geneticist is evaluating a family with a history of a rare autosomal dominant disorder. She notes that individuals with the same pathogenic genotype exhibit a wide range of clinical signs and symptoms, from very mild skin findings to severe systemic disease. For instance, in neurofibromatosis type 1, some family members may only have café-au-lait spots, while others have neurofibromas and optic gliomas. Which genetic principle best describes this phenomenon?",
    "options": [
      "A. Incomplete penetrance.",
      "B. Pleiotropy.",
      "C. Locus heterogeneity.",
      "D. Variable expressivity.",
      "E. Mosaicism."
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Variable expressivity is defined as 'Patients with the same genotype have varying phenotypes.' The example given in the text, where two patients with NF1 have varying disease severity, perfectly illustrates this concept. Incomplete penetrance means not all individuals with the genotype express the phenotype at all, while pleiotropy is one gene affecting multiple organ systems."

    "question": "A newborn is diagnosed with cystic fibrosis after a positive newborn screen showing elevated immunoreactive trypsinogen. The underlying genetic defect is a ΔF508 deletion in the CFTR gene. This mutation leads to an improperly folded CFTR protein, which is then retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and targeted for degradation, preventing its transport to the cell membrane. Which of the following is the direct consequence of the absent CFTR channel at the apical surface of respiratory epithelial cells?",
    "options": [
      "A. Increased secretion of chloride and water, leading to thin, watery mucus.",
      "B. Decreased secretion of chloride and water, leading to abnormally thick mucus.",
      "C. Increased reabsorption of sodium and water, leading to dilute mucus.",
      "D. Decreased reabsorption of sodium, leading to a more positive transepithelial potential difference.",
      "E. Failure to reabsorb chloride in sweat glands, leading to hypotonic sweat."
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The text explains that the absence of the CFTR protein from the cell membrane leads to '↓ Cl− (and H2O and HCO3–) secretion.' This lack of ion and water movement into the airway lumen results in the 'abnormally thick mucus secreted into lungs/GI tract' that is characteristic of cystic fibrosis. The sweat gland defect is a failure to reabsorb chloride, leading to hypertonic (salty) sweat."

      "D. Duchenne muscular dystrophy.",
      "E. Rett syndrome."
    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The combination of X-linked inheritance, onset before age 5, pelvic girdle weakness, calf pseudohypertrophy, and the Gowers sign is classic for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The text specifies it is 'typically due to frameshift deletions or nonsense mutations → truncated or absent dystrophin protein.' Becker dystrophy is less severe and typically caused by non-frameshift deletions."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The clinical findings describe Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18). The text provides a table of prenatal screening results, which shows that for trisomy 18, hCG, estriol, and AFP are all decreased ('every prenatal screening marker decreases'). The mnemonic 'Election age (18)' helps recall the trisomy number."

    ],
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The patient is presenting with Wernicke encephalopathy, caused by thiamine (Vitamin B1) deficiency, which is common in chronic alcohol overuse. The text explains that thiamine, as thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), is a critical cofactor for the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex. Administering dextrose to a thiamine-deficient patient worsens the condition because it drives glycolysis, increasing the flux of pyruvate that cannot be metabolized by the dysfunctional PDH complex, thus depleting any remaining thiamine and exacerbating ATP depletion in the brain."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The clinical picture of subacute combined degeneration (neurologic symptoms) and megaloblastic anemia in a patient with terminal ileum resection is classic for Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) deficiency. The text explains that B12 is a cofactor for two enzymes: methionine synthase (which converts homocysteine to methionine) and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (which converts methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA). Deficiency of B12 leads to the accumulation of both substrates, causing elevated serum levels of homocysteine and methylmalonic acid."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The patient has Homocystinuria, most commonly due to cystathionine synthase deficiency. This enzyme converts homocysteine to cystathionine, a step that requires vitamin B6. Its deficiency causes homocysteine to accumulate and makes cysteine an essential amino acid. Therefore, treatment, as stated in the text, involves restricting the precursor (methionine) and supplementing with the product (cysteine) and the necessary cofactor (vitamin B6).

    "explanation": "Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency is the most common urea cycle disorder and is uniquely X-linked recessive (though it can present in females). The text explains that in OTC deficiency, excess carbamoyl phosphate from the mitochondria spills into the cytoplasm and is converted to orotic acid via the pyrimidine synthesis pathway. This leads to the key findings of hyperammonemia combined with elevated orotic acid. A deficiency in CPS I would also cause hyperammonemia but would not lead to orotic aciduria, as carbamoyl phosphate would not be produced."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The text explains that in the fasting state, high glucagon leads to increased cAMP and activation of protein kinase A. This 'phosphorylates the bifunctional enzyme, activating the FBPase-2 domain and inactivating the PFK-2 domain. This leads to lower levels of F2,6BP, which in turn relieves inhibition of Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1 (stimulating gluconeogenesis) and reduces activation of PFK-1 (inhibiting glycolysis).

    "question": "A patient is started on the immunosuppressant cyclosporine following a renal transplant. This drug is highly effective at preventing acute rejection by suppressing T-cell mediated immunity. What is the specific intracellular mechanism of action by which cyclosporine exerts its effect?",
    "options": [
      "A. It reversibly inhibits IMP dehydrogenase, blocking purine synthesis in lymphocytes.",
      "B. It inhibits mTOR, preventing the cellular response to Interleukin-2.",
      "C. It binds to cyclophilin, and this complex inhibits calcineurin, thereby blocking the transcription of Interleukin-2.",
      "D. It is a precursor to 6-mercaptopurine, which blocks de novo purine synthesis.",
      "E. It acts as a monoclonal antibody that blocks the IL-2 receptor."
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The table of immunosuppressants clearly states that cyclosporine is a 'Calcineurin inhibitor; binds cyclophilin' and that it 'Blocks T-cell activation by preventing IL-2 transcription.' Inhibition of calcineurin prevents the dephosphorylation and activation of NFAT, a key transcription factor for IL-2."

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This clinical scenario describes Hyper-IgM syndrome. The text states that the most common cause is a 'defective CD40L on Th cells → class switching defect; X-linked recessive.' The interaction between CD40 on B cells and CD40L on activated T helper cells is the critical second signal for B cells to undergo class switching and affinity maturation. Without it, B cells can only produce IgM."

His umbilical cord stump was also noted to have separated abnormally late, at 5 weeks of age. A complete blood count reveals a marked neutrophilia, but a biopsy of an infected site shows a paucity of neutrophils. This condition is caused by a defect in a protein on the surface of phagocytes that is critical for their adhesion to the endothelium and subsequent migration into tissues. Which protein is most likely deficient?",
    "options": [
      "A. NADPH oxidase",

      "E. STAT3"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "This is a classic presentation of Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency (LAD) Type 1. The text states that LAD is caused by a 'defect in LFA-1 integrin (CD18) protein on phagocytes leads to impaired migration and chemotaxis.' This explains the late separation of the umbilical cord, lack of pus (neutrophils can't get to the site of infection), and the high neutrophil count in the blood (they can't exit the vasculature)."

"options": ["A. Drug A is likely a small, lipophilic molecule that distributes to all tissues including fat.", "B. Drug B is likely a large, charged molecule that is highly bound to plasma proteins.", "C. Drug A is likely confined to the intravascular compartment, suggesting it is large and/or highly protein-bound.", "D. Drug B would be effectively cleared by hemodialysis.", "E. Drug A and Drug B would have the same half-life if their clearance is identical."],
"answer": "C",
"explanation": "The text explains that a low Vd is characteristic of drugs that are confined to the intravascular compartment, which applies to large, charged, or highly plasma protein-bound molecules. A high Vd is characteristic of small, lipophilic molecules that distribute widely into tissues like fat. Hemodialysis is most effective for drugs with a low Vd, not a high one. Half-life depends on both Vd and clearance (t1/2 = 0.7 x Vd / CL), so they would not have the same half-life if their Vd is different but clearance is identical."

"question": "A patient overdoses on a weak acid drug with a pKa of 3.5, such as phenobarbital. To enhance the elimination of this drug through the kidneys, what intervention should be implemented and why?",
"options": ["A. Administer ammonium chloride to acidify the urine, which traps the drug in its ionized form.", "B. Administer sodium bicarbonate to alkalinize the urine, which traps the drug in its ionized form.", "C. Administer a diuretic to increase urine flow, which is the primary mechanism for clearing weak acids.", "D. Administer flumazenil, which acts as a competitive antagonist at the drug's receptor.", "E. No intervention is needed as weak acids are not significantly reabsorbed."],
"answer": "B",
"explanation": "The text states that for weak acids, such as phenobarbital and aspirin, an overdose can be treated with 'sodium bicarbonate to alkalinize urine.' The principle is that ionized species are trapped in the urine and cleared quickly. In an alkaline environment (higher pH), a weak acid (RCOOH) will dissociate into its ionized form (RCOO-), which is less lipid-soluble and thus cannot be easily reabsorbed across the renal tubules."

"question": "In a clinical trial for a new antihypertensive drug, Drug X is compared to a placebo. A noncompetitive antagonist is then added to the Drug X group. How would the addition of this noncompetitive antagonist affect the dose-response curve for Drug X in terms of its efficacy and potency?",
"options": ["A. It would shift the curve to the right, decreasing potency but not affecting efficacy.", "B. It would shift the curve to the left, increasing potency but not affecting efficacy.", "C. It would lower the maximum height of the curve, decreasing efficacy but not affecting potency.", "D. It would raise the maximum height of the curve, increasing efficacy but not affecting potency.", "E. It would shift the curve to the right and lower the maximum height, decreasing both potency and efficacy."],
"answer": "C",
"explanation": "The table on receptor binding and the accompanying graphs show that a noncompetitive antagonist reduces the maximal effect (efficacy) of an agonist but does not change the EC50 (potency). Therefore, the dose-response curve would have a lower Emax (reduced efficacy) but the concentration needed to achieve 50% of this new, lower maximum effect would be unchanged (independent potency)."

"question": "A clinical trial is evaluating a new screening test for a certain type of cancer. The researchers find that by lowering the cut-off value for a positive result, they are able to correctly identify more individuals who truly have the cancer. However, this change also results in more healthy individuals being incorrectly identified as having the disease. How does lowering the cut-off value affect the test's characteristics?",
"options": ["A. It increases specificity and increases the positive predictive value (PPV).", "B. It decreases sensitivity and decreases the negative predictive value (NPV).", "C. It increases sensitivity and increases the negative predictive value (NPV).", "D. It decreases specificity and increases the positive predictive value (PPV).", "E. It increases both sensitivity and specificity."],
"answer": "C",
"explanation": "The diagram illustrating the effect of changing cut-off values shows that lowering the cut-off value (moving from B to A) leads to an increase in True Positives (TP) but also an increase in False Positives (FP). This results in an increased sensitivity (TP/[TP+FN]) and an increased Negative Predictive Value (NPV). Conversely, specificity (TN/[TN+FP]) and Positive Predictive Value (PPV) are decreased."

"question": "In a study investigating the link between a new industrial chemical exposure and the development of bladder cancer, researchers find a strong association. However, they later realize that the workers exposed to the chemical were also far more likely to be heavy smokers than the unexposed control group. When the data is stratified by smoking status, the association between the chemical and bladder cancer disappears among both smokers and non-smokers. What type of bias does this scenario describe?",
"options": ["A. Recall bias", "B. Lead-time bias", "C. Effect modification", "D. Confounding", "E. Hawthorne effect"],
"answer": "D",
"explanation": "This is a classic example of confounding. The text defines a confounding factor as one that is 'related to both exposure and outcome' and 'distorts the effect on the outcome.' Smoking is the confounder here, as it is associated with both the chemical exposure (the workers) and the outcome (bladder cancer). When the data is stratified by the confounder (smoking), the original, spurious association between the chemical and cancer disappears, revealing the true relationship."

"question": "A 60-year-old patient with atrial fibrillation is started on warfarin for stroke prevention. The patient is also taking a medication for a fungal infection that is a known inhibitor of the cytochrome P-450 system. Which of the following antifungals would increase the patient's risk of bleeding by inhibiting warfarin metabolism?",
"options": ["A. Griseofulvin", "B. Amphotericin B", "C. Nystatin", "D. Fluconazole", "E. Terbinafine"],
"answer": "D",
"explanation": "The table on 'Cytochrome P-450 interactions' lists inhibitors using the mnemonic 'SICK FACES...'. Fluconazole is one of the listed inhibitors. By inhibiting the P-450 enzymes that metabolize warfarin, fluconazole will increase warfarin's plasma concentration and its anticoagulant effect, thus increasing the risk of bleeding (elevated INR)."

"question": "A 30-year-old male with a history of intravenous drug use is diagnosed with infective endocarditis caused by Staphylococcus aureus. He is started on a lipopeptide antibiotic that disrupts the bacterial cell membrane of gram-positive cocci. However, this drug is noted to be ineffective for treating pneumonia. Which antibiotic is being used, and why is it inactivated in the lungs?",
"options": ["A. Vancomycin; due to poor penetration into lung tissue", "B. Linezolid; due to resistance from lung pathogens", "C. Daptomycin; due to binding and inactivation by pulmonary surfactant", "D. Clindamycin; due to its bacteriostatic nature in the lung environment", "E. Penicillin G; due to β-lactamase production by lung pathogens"],
"answer": "C",
"explanation": "The text describes daptomycin as a 'lipopeptide that disrupts cell membranes of gram-positive cocci' and is used for 'S aureus skin infections...bacteremia, infective endocarditis.' It explicitly states it is 'Not used for pneumonia (avidly binds to and is inactivated by surfactant).' The mnemonic 'Dapto-myo-skin' highlights its use for skin infections and its potential for myopathy."

"question": "A medical student is analyzing data from a study with a sample size of 25. The study compares the proportion of male and female students who passed a specific exam. Since the sample size is small, which statistical test would be most appropriate to check for a significant difference between these two proportions?",
"options": ["A. t-test", "B. ANOVA", "C. Chi-square (χ²)", "D. Pearson correlation", "E. Fisher's exact test"],
"answer": "E",
"explanation": "The 'Common statistical tests' chart shows that to compare percentages or proportions of categorical outcomes, one uses either a Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. The text specifies to use 'Fisher’s exact test instead of chi-square test with small samples.' Since the study involves categorical outcomes (pass/fail) and has a small sample size (n<30 often used as a rule of thumb), Fisher's exact test is the most appropriate choice."

"question": "A public health official is investigating an outbreak of food poisoning at a picnic. Of the 100 people who ate potato salad, 40 became ill. Of the 50 people who did not eat the potato salad, 5 became ill. What is the Relative Risk (RR) of getting sick associated with eating the potato salad?",
"options": ["A. 0.25", "B. 4.0", "C. 5.7", "D. 8.0", "E. 0.1"],
"answer": "B",
"explanation": "Relative Risk (RR) is calculated as the incidence in the exposed group divided by the incidence in the unexposed group. Exposed group (ate salad): a = 40, b = 60. Unexposed group (did not eat salad): c = 5, d = 45. The risk in the exposed group is a / (a+b) = 40 / (40+60) = 40/100 = 0.4. The risk in the unexposed group is c / (c+d) = 5 / (5+45) = 5/50 = 0.1. The Relative Risk is (0.4) / (0.1) = 4.0."

"question": "A new diagnostic test for a disease has a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 80%. If this test is used in a population where the prevalence of the disease is 10%, what is the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of the test?",
"options": ["A. 90%", "B. 80%", "C. 32%", "D. 97%", "E. 18%"],
"answer": "C",
"explanation": "To calculate PPV, we can use a 2x2 table for a population of 1000 people. Prevalence = 10%, so 100 people have the disease and 900 do not. Sensitivity = 90%, so True Positives (TP) = 0.90 * 100 = 90. False Negatives (FN) = 100 - 90 = 10. Specificity = 80%, so True Negatives (TN) = 0.80 * 900 = 720. False Positives (FP) = 900 - 720 = 180. PPV = TP / (TP + FP) = 90 / (90 + 180) = 90 / 270 = 1/3 ≈ 33.3%."

"question": "An infant born to a mother who was not immunized presents with a poor suck, constipation, and descending flaccid paralysis ('floppy baby syndrome'). The parents admit to feeding the infant raw honey. This condition is caused by a neurotoxin that cleaves SNARE proteins, preventing the release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction. Which organism produces this toxin?",
"options": ["A. Clostridium tetani", "B. Corynebacterium diphtheriae", "C. Clostridium botulinum", "D. Bacillus anthracis", "E. Shigella spp."],
"answer": "C",
"explanation": "The text describes infant botulism as being caused by the 'ingestion of spores (eg, from soil, raw honey)' with the toxin produced in vivo. The botulinum toxin works by cleaving SNARE proteins, preventing acetylcholine release and causing a descending flaccid paralysis. The clinical presentation of 'floppy baby syndrome' is characteristic of infant botulism from Clostridium botulinum."
