    "question": "A 28-year-old woman is in therapy for relationship difficulties. She tells her therapist that she sees her new boss as a perfect, flawless leader, much like she viewed her father during her childhood. However, after receiving her first minor criticism at work, she describes her boss as completely incompetent and malevolent. This rapid shift in perception, from viewing individuals as either entirely good or entirely bad, is characteristic of which immature ego defense?",

      "B. Reaction Formation",
      "C. Idealization",
      "D. Projection"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Splitting is an immature ego defense characterized by the belief that people are either all good or all bad at different times, reflecting an intolerance of ambiguity. This patient's shift from viewing her boss as perfect (idealization) to seeing him as entirely bad after a minor negative event is a classic example of splitting, which is common in borderline personality disorder.

      "D. Failure of the urachus to involute, associated with hydronephrosis."
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "A duplex collecting system is caused by the bifurcation of the ureteric bud before it enters the metanephric blastema. The text explicitly states this anomaly is strongly associated with vesicoureteral reflux and/or ureteral obstruction, which increases the risk for urinary tract infections (UTIs)."

      "C. Type 4 (Hyperkalemic) RTA",
      "D. RTA secondary to acetazolamide use"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Type 1 (Distal) RTA is characterized by the inability of α-intercalated cells to secrete H+, leading to an inability to acidify the urine (urine pH > 5.5). This condition results in hypokalemia and is associated with autoimmune diseases like Sjögren syndrome. Type 2 involves a defect in bicarbonate reabsorption and the urine can acidify. Type 4 is associated with hyperkalemia. [3, 4, 25, 31, 32]"

In addition to its potent diuretic effect, which of the following sets of electrolyte disturbances is a well-known adverse effect profile for this class of drug?",
    "options": [
      "A. Hyperkalemia, hypercalcemia, metabolic acidosis",
      "B. Hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, metabolic alkalosis",
      "C. Hypokalemia, hypercalcemia, metabolic alkalosis",
      "D. Hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, metabolic acidosis"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The medication described is a loop diuretic (e.g., furosemide). These drugs inhibit the Na+/K+/2Cl− cotransporter, which leads to increased excretion of Na+, K+, and Cl−. They also cause increased excretion of Ca2+ and Mg2+. The resulting volume depletion and potassium loss lead to a metabolic alkalosis. Therefore, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and metabolic alkalosis are characteristic side effects. [30, 48, 49, 50]"

    "question": "A 60-year-old male with a history of poorly controlled hypertension is evaluated for worsening renal function. His GFR is significantly reduced. His physician considers initiating treatment with an ACE inhibitor. How would this medication affect the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and filtration fraction (FF) by altering glomerular dynamics?",
    "options": [
      "A. It dilates the afferent arteriole, causing an increase in GFR and FF.",
      "B. It constricts the afferent arteriole, causing a decrease in GFR and FF.",
      "C. It dilates the efferent arteriole, causing a decrease in GFR and FF.",
      "D. It constricts the efferent arteriole, causing an increase in GFR and FF."
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "ACE inhibitors block the production of Angiotensin II. Angiotensin II preferentially constricts the efferent arteriole, which increases GFR and FF. By inhibiting this effect, ACE inhibitors cause vasodilation of the efferent arteriole. This reduces glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure, leading to a decrease in both GFR and the filtration fraction. [2]"

      "D. Ulipristal"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Clomiphene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that acts as an antagonist at the hypothalamus. This action blocks the negative feedback of estrogen, leading to an increase in GnRH, FSH, and LH, which stimulates ovulation. It is a first-line treatment for infertility in PCOS. Letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, is also used but works by a different mechanism. Leuprolide is a GnRH analog, and ulipristal is an antiprogestin."

    "question": "A patient with metastatic prostate cancer is being treated with a GnRH analog in a continuous fashion. While this therapy is effective long-term at reducing testosterone levels, the physician warns the patient that his symptoms might briefly worsen after starting the medication. This initial 'tumor flare' is due to what mechanism?",
    "options": [
      "A. Antagonistic effect at the GnRH receptor, causing a surge in testosterone production.",
      "B. Agonistic effect at the GnRH receptor, causing a transient increase in LH and FSH release.",
      "C. Downregulation of 5α-reductase, leading to a temporary increase in testosterone.",
      "D. Inhibition of androgen receptors, causing a compensatory surge in LH."
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "When used in a continuous fashion, GnRH analogs like leuprolide initially act as agonists at the GnRH receptor in the pituitary. This causes a transient surge in the release of LH and FSH, which in turn stimulates the Leydig cells to produce more testosterone, potentially causing a 'tumor flare' in prostate cancer. Over time, this continuous stimulation leads to downregulation of the GnRH receptors and subsequent hypogonadism."

She exhibits nystagmus, ataxia, and confusion. Her physician is concerned about Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome and prepares to administer IV fluids. What is the most critical first step in management to prevent precipitating a more severe, irreversible neurologic condition?",
    "options": [
      "A. Administer IV dextrose immediately to correct potential hypoglycemia.",
      "B. Administer IV vitamin B1 (thiamine) before administering any dextrose.",
      "C. Administer a long-acting benzodiazepine to manage withdrawal.",
      "D. Obtain a head CT to rule out other causes of confusion."
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The patient's symptoms constitute the classic triad of Wernicke encephalopathy (confusion, ophthalmoplegia [nystagmus], ataxia). This is caused by thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. The text explicitly states that symptoms can be precipitated by administering dextrose before vitamin B1, as glucose metabolism consumes thiamine, worsening the deficiency and potentially leading to irreversible Korsakoff syndrome. Therefore, IV thiamine must be given before dextrose."

      "C. Anorexia nervosa, restricting type",
      "D. Binge-eating disorder"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The patient meets the criteria for anorexia nervosa due to her inappropriately low body weight (BMI < 18.5), intense fear of weight gain, and body image distortion. Because her disordered behaviors are limited to dieting, fasting, and/or over-exercising without recurrent bingeing or purging, the specific subtype is restricting type."

    "explanation": "This patient has symptoms of mineralocorticoid excess (hypertension, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis) but with low aldosterone. This is characteristic of the Syndrome of Apparent Mineralocorticoid Excess (SAME). In this condition, cortisol, which is in much higher concentration than aldosterone, activates the mineralocorticoid receptor. Normally, the enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD) converts cortisol to inactive cortisone in renal cells. The text notes that glycyrrhetinic acid, found in licorice, blocks the activity of 11β-HSD, leading to an acquired form of this syndrome."

      "C. Hot flashes and ovarian cysts",
      "D. Migraines and liver failure"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The drug described is tamoxifen. As a SERM, it has tissue-specific effects. Its antagonist activity at the breast is therapeutic. However, its agonist activity at the uterus increases the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer. Like estrogen, it also increases the risk of thromboembolic events such as DVT and pulmonary embolism. It is an agonist at the bone, which helps prevent osteoporosis, making option A incorrect."

      "B. Anabolic-androgenic steroids",
      "C. Marijuana",
      "D. Growth hormone"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The use of exogenous anabolic-androgenic steroids leads to a state of hyperandrogenism, causing acne and aggression. The excess androgens are aromatized to estrogens, causing gynecomastia. The exogenous testosterone suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to decreased LH and FSH, which results in decreased endogenous testosterone production and testicular atrophy (small testes)."

      "C. 17α-hydroxylase",
      "D. 5α-reductase"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "While the provided text does not cover congenital adrenal hyperplasia in detail, this is a classic USMLE presentation. The most common form of CAH is 21-hydroxylase deficiency, which impairs the synthesis of both cortisol and aldosterone. Lack of aldosterone causes salt wasting (hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypotension), and lack of cortisol impairs the stress response. Precursors are shunted to androgen production, causing virilization in females (ambiguous genitalia) and normal genitalia in males. The salt-wasting crisis presents in the first few weeks of life."

        "explanation": "The right main stem bronchus is wider, more vertical, and shorter than the left, making it the more common site for inhaled foreign bodies. When an individual aspirates an object while in an upright position, it is most likely to travel down this path and lodge in the right lower lobe."

        "question": "A 45-year-old male is brought to the emergency department after being rescued from a house fire. He is confused, has cherry-red skin, and complains of a severe headache. Although his pulse oximetry reads 99% on room air, his total blood oxygen content is significantly decreased. This discrepancy is best explained by carbon monoxide's effect on the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve and hemoglobin binding, which is characterized by:",
        "options": [
            "A. A rightward shift of the curve, decreasing hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen and a normal PaO2.",
            "B. A leftward shift of the curve, increasing hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen and a reduced SaO2.",
            "C. A leftward shift of the curve, increasing hemoglobin's affinity for O2, leading to reduced unloading in tissues, despite a normal PaO2.",
            "D. Oxidation of heme iron to Fe3+, preventing oxygen binding and causing a rightward shift.",
            "E. Competitive binding with oxygen, a normal PaO2, and a proportional decrease in both SaO2 and total oxygen content."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is characterized by CO binding competitively to hemoglobin with over 200 times the affinity of oxygen. This forms carboxyhemoglobin, which reduces the number of available oxygen-binding sites. Crucially, the binding of CO to one site on hemoglobin causes a conformational change that increases the affinity of the remaining sites for oxygen, resulting in a leftward shift of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve. This increased affinity impairs the unloading of oxygen to the tissues. The partial pressure of dissolved oxygen in the arterial blood (PaO2) remains normal, and pulse oximeters cannot distinguish carboxyhemoglobin from oxyhemoglobin, leading to a falsely high SaO2 reading. The total oxygen content, however, is significantly reduced due to the unavailability of hemoglobin for oxygen transport."

        "question": "A 68-year-old retired sandblaster presents with progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion. A chest X-ray reveals multiple small, rounded nodular opacities predominantly in the upper lobes and 'eggshell' calcification of the hilar lymph nodes. This patient's occupation and radiological findings are highly suggestive of a specific pneumoconiosis, which also significantly increases his risk for which of the following infections?",
        "options": [
            "A. Aspergillosis",
            "B. Tuberculosis",

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The patient's history of sandblasting and the characteristic findings of upper lobe nodules with 'eggshell' calcification of hilar lymph nodes are pathognomonic for silicosis. It is thought that silica disrupts phagolysosomes and impairs macrophage function, which increases the patient's susceptibility to Tuberculosis."

        "question": "A 55-year-old man with a 40-pack-year smoking history is diagnosed with chronic bronchitis. His condition is clinically defined by a productive cough for at least three months over two consecutive years. Pathologically, this condition is primarily characterized by which of the following changes in the bronchi, leading to the observed symptoms?",
        "options": [
            "A. Destruction of alveolar walls and permanent airspace enlargement.",
            "B. Hypertrophy and hyperplasia of mucus-secreting glands in the bronchi.",

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Chronic bronchitis, a form of COPD, is pathologically defined by the hypertrophy and hyperplasia of mucus-secreting glands within the large bronchi. This leads to an increase in the Reid index (the ratio of the thickness of the gland layer to the bronchial wall thickness) to over 50% and results in the characteristic chronic productive cough."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "For patients with severe allergic asthma and elevated IgE levels refractory to standard therapy, Omalizumab is a suitable treatment. [2] It is a monoclonal anti-IgE antibody that binds to unbound serum IgE. This action prevents IgE from binding to its receptor (FcεRI) on mast cells, thereby inhibiting mast cell degranulation and the subsequent release of inflammatory mediators."
