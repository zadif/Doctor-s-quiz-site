    "question": "A 65-year-old male undergoes a total mesorectal excision for a mid-rectal adenocarcinoma. During the procedure, the surgeon identifies the main arterial supply to the rectum, which is a direct continuation of the inferior mesenteric artery. In addition to this primary vessel, the surgeon is aware of a secondary artery that arises from the internal iliac artery on each side and passes to the rectum within the lateral ligaments. According to the provided text, what is the anatomical characteristic and frequency of this secondary artery?",

    "explanation": "The text states that the middle rectal artery arises from the internal iliac artery and passes to the rectum in the lateral ligaments. It specifies that this artery is 'usually small and often only present on one side, and divides into several branches'. Option A is incorrect as it's not large or consistently bilateral. Option B is incorrect; the superior rectal artery is the main supply. Option D describes the inferior rectal artery. Option E is incorrect as it's not the main supply to the fascia and its preservation depends on the surgical context.",
