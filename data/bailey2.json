    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The text states, 'Tumours <10 mm in size have an excellent prognosis and appendicectomy achieves cure.' While this tumor is slightly larger, it specifies that a right hemicolectomy is considered for positive margins or deep mesoappendiceal invasion (>3mm) or tumors >20mm. For a 15mm tumor without these features, watchful waiting post-appendectomy is often standard, but based on the provided text, none of the criteria for hemicolectomy are met definitively. However, other guidelines might recommend hemicolectomy for tumors >1cm. Given the text's specific cutoffs, and the lack of other adverse features, simple appendectomy could be considered sufficient, but practice varies. Re-reading the text: 'A right hemicolectomy should be considered in the rare situations of positive or unclear margins or deep mesoappendiceal invasion (>3 mm)... An oncological right hemicolectomy should be performed for tumours >20 mm.' This implies a tumor between 10mm and 20mm without adverse features does not automatically require hemicolectomy.
