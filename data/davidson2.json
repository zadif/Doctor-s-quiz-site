    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The primary automatic control of breathing originates from respiratory motor neurons in the posterior medulla. Their activity is modulated by central chemoreceptors located in the ventrolateral medulla, which are highly sensitive to the pH of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The lungs have intrinsic mechanisms to match ventilation and perfusion. At a local level, hypoxia (low oxygen) in an under-ventilated area of the lung causes constriction of the pulmonary arterioles supplying that region, diverting blood flow away from it. [6] Simultaneously, increased CO2 in the airways of that region (due to under-ventilation) causes local bronchodilation to try and improve ventilation.

[13, 14] The pathophysiology involves ventilation-perfusion mismatch where a diseased lung region is under-ventilated. Blood perfusing this region remains hypoxic. The respiratory center increases overall ventilation, and the neighboring normal lung regions can increase CO2 excretion to compensate, normalizing the arterial PaCO2. However, these normal regions cannot significantly augment oxygen uptake because the hemoglobin passing through them is already fully saturated.

    "question": "A 5-month-old infant presents with marked hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. The condition was diagnosed in the first week of life. Genetic testing reveals an activating mutation in the KCNJ11 gene, which encodes the KIR6.2 subunit of the pancreatic KATP channel. This has resulted in permanent neonatal diabetes. Based on this specific genetic defect, what is the most effective and transformative long-term treatment for this infant?",
    "options": [
      "A. Life-long treatment with a continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump.",

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The text describes neonatal diabetes and its genetic causes. It specifies that approximately two-thirds of patients with permanent neonatal diabetes have an activating mutation in the genes for the KATP channel (KIR6.2 or SUR1). These mutations cause the channel to remain open, preventing insulin secretion. The text highlights a major therapeutic breakthrough: 'it has been shown, however, that these individuals do respond to sulphonylureas; this finding has transformed their care, over 90% being managed with oral sulphonylurea treatment.' Sulphonylureas work by directly closing the KATP channel, thus restoring insulin secretion.",

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Red cell precursors in the bone marrow must acquire a minimum amount of haemoglobin before they are released into the circulation.

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The body has large liver stores of vitamin B12 (enough for about 3 years). This is supplemented by a very efficient enterohepatic circulation, where vitamin B12 secreted into the bile is reabsorbed in the terminal ileum.

'Stage IV disease' is one of the 7 factors. The text states Ann Arbor Stage III or IV is advanced. So Stage B symptom is one factor. WBC > 15 is a second factor (18). Lymphopenia < 0.6 is a third factor (0.4). His age is <45, albumin is normal, Hb is normal. So he has 3 adverse factors (Male gender, WBC>15, Lymphopenia <0.6). *Correction: The Hasenclever score applies to ADVANCED stage disease (Ann Arbor III/IV). The prompt says Stage IIIB.

    "question": "A 68-year-old male is diagnosed with multiple myeloma. He presents with severe back pain, anaemia, and renal impairment. What is the primary pathophysiological mechanism by which myeloma cells cause lytic bone lesions and hypercalcaemia?",
    "options": [
      "A. Direct invasion and destruction of bone tissue by the malignant plasma cells.",
      "B. Production of cytokines that stimulate osteoclasts, leading to increased bone resorption.",
      "C. Secretion of excess parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) by the plasma cells.",
      "D. Deposition of paraprotein in the bone matrix, which weakens the bone structure."
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "In multiple myeloma, the malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow produce various cytokines (such as RANKL) that stimulate the activity of osteoclasts, the cells responsible for bone resorption. This leads to a net breakdown of bone, resulting in the characteristic lytic lesions, bone pain, pathological fractures, and the release of calcium into the bloodstream (hypercalcaemia). [66]",

    "options": [
      "A. A reactive proliferation of fibroblasts in response to growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor, released from an excess of abnormal megakaryocytes in the marrow.",
      "B. Direct infiltration of the bone marrow by fibrous tissue-producing cancer cells.",

      "D. Deposition of collagen in the marrow as a result of a genetic defect in collagen metabolism."
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "In myelofibrosis, the fibrosis within the bone marrow is a reactive process, not a primary malignant proliferation of fibroblasts. The disease begins with a clonal proliferation of haematopoietic cells, particularly an excess of abnormal megakaryocytes. These megakaryocytes release various growth factors (like PDGF) that stimulate the marrow fibroblasts to proliferate and lay down collagen, leading to progressive fibrosis and replacement of normal marrow tissue.

    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The clinical presentation of a pale retina with a 'cherry-red' spot at the macula is classic for a central retinal artery occlusion. The text explains that the hyaloid artery initially supplies the lens and vitreous but regresses, leaving only the central retinal artery and its branches to supply the inner retina.
